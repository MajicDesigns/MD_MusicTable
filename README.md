# Musical Notes Lookup Table #
 
This class contains a lookup table for musical note information that
can be searched by name or note/octave (find\*()) functions. Elements of
the table can then be retrieved (get\*()). These include the note name, 
frequency octave and ISO/ANSI note designation.

Use this class by first finding the table entry and then retrieving the 
data you need, one field at a time.
